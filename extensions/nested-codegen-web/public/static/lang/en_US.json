Compared with the general floating-point notation, BCD code can not only preserve the accuracy of the numerical value but also avoid the time consumed by the computer in the floating-point calculation. In addition, BCD coding is also commonly used for other computations requiring high precision. \n\nThe BCD code is a four-digit binary code, which converts decimal digits into binary digits. However, unlike normal conversion, each decimal digit 0-9 corresponds to a four-digit binary code as follows: decimal 0 corresponds to binary 0000; Decimal 1 corresponds to binary 0001...... .9 1001 The next 10 have two of the above codes to indicate that 10 in 00010000, that is, the BCD code is carried on meeting 1001, unlike ordinary binary code, which is carried until 1111. \n\n@reference: Hutool":"",
